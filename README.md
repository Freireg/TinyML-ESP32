# TinyML-ESP32
My personal repo to test TinyML Applications
- Model: Sine Wave Example
- Current State: Not Working

> Self note: The application in main.c is based on a different example (the  construction and initialization of the class NeuralNetwork). My goal here is to creat a versatile class that could work in any TinyML application.
